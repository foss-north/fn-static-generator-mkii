  title: "An engineer's guide to Linux Kernel upgrades"
  day: apr14
  slot: slot5
  abstract:
    - "Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a
      kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production
      engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too
      often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more
      obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But
      introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any
      other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company
      and their service of being exploited."

    - "One of the reasons SREs and engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel
      upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel
      release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel
      releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix
      release from a feature release. We also describe how kernel releases are
      implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy
      kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk."

  title: "What is Linux kernel keystore and why you should use it in your next application"
  abstract:
    - "Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by
      any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and
      share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data,
      negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single
      byte of the underlying cryptographic material."

    - "This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native
      environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other
      using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has
      some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security
      failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may
      allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run
      an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys."

    - "On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates
      with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a
      single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets.
      Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key
      management system."

      project we had explored this and discovered a vibrant, evolving ecosystem
      which made me eager to share my findings."

      scripting. We’ll explore key language features such as type annotations,
      tools for testing and static analysis, and modern dependency management

      algorithms with open-source implementations. This initiative marked the
      first step toward standardizing cryptographic algorithm declarations in
      Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Such standardization can reduce
      inefficiencies in compliance and foster collaboration across
      industries—from export control and security compliance to quantum safety
      readiness, among other benefits, that will be highlighted during the
      talk."

      standardization initiatives, SCANOSS's efforts to improve crypto

       people USED it, uploading documents and such. So the lock-in was complete."

    - "The EU Cyber Resilience Act will change software development forever and
      it has a set of rules that affect Open Source projects too. The main focus
      is the commercial software developers where up to 80% of their software
      sold is made of open source. Let's look at the new legislation, how it
      affects you and what the Software Bill Of Materials got to do with it."

  abstract:
    - "Authorization isn't just a checkbox in the security compliance list—it's
      a fundamental security control that shapes how software behaves in
      production. Yet most of us have wrestled with authz systems that either
      trap us in vendor ecosystems or leave us maintaining a tangled mess of
      if-statements that make us question our life choices. But there’s hope!
      From the CNCF to the OpenID Foundation, the open source community is doing
      some really neat stuff with authz right now."
    - "In this talk, we'll explore how modern authz patterns are embedding
      security principles as a core part of the software development
      lifecycle—so we can catch access control vulnerabilities during dev rather
      than in prod, and build more secure, maintainable systems. We'll cover
      practical patterns for implementing robust access control logic,
      strategies for testing authorization rules as part of your security
      testing suite, and techniques for making authorization an integral part of
      your development process from day one."

    - "The automotive industry has long been constrained by proprietary
      software, fragmented ecosystems, and slow innovation cycles. As
      software-defined vehicles (SDVs) become the norm, the industry faces a
      critical decision: continue with closed, siloed approaches or embrace open
      collaboration to drive real innovation."
    - "In this talk, we’ll explore how open-source software is poised to break
      down these barriers, enabling faster development, cross-industry
      collaboration, and a more dynamic ecosystem. From embedded vehicle
      platforms to cloud-based mobility solutions, we'll discuss why open source
      isn’t just a trend—it’s the key to transforming the future of automotive.
      We'll also examine the challenges and business implications of adopting
      open source in an industry historically resistant to change."
    - "Join us to discover how open source will shape the next generation of
      mobility and what it means for OEMs, suppliers, and developers."
