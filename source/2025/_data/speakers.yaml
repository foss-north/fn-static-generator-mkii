  title: "An engineer's guide to Linux Kernel upgrades"
  day: apr14
  slot: slot5
  abstract:
    - "Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a
      kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production
      engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too
      often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more
      obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But
      introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any
      other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company
      and their service of being exploited."

    - "One of the reasons SREs and engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel
      upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel
      release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel
      releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix
      release from a feature release. We also describe how kernel releases are
      implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy
      kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk."

  title: "What is Linux kernel keystore and why you should use it in your next application"
  abstract:
    - "Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by
      any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and
      share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data,
      negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single
      byte of the underlying cryptographic material."

    - "This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native
      environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other
      using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has
      some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security
      failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may
      allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run
      an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys."

    - "On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates
      with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a
      single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets.
      Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key
      management system."

  abstract:
    - "Python is one of the most popular programming languages, predominantly
      with beginners, web developers, data science and AI. It is also the go-to
      language for many to create smaller scripts or automations. But how do you
      take it to the next level when working on a larger codebase? In a recent
      project we had explored this and discovered a vibrant, evolving ecosystem
      which made me eager to share my findings."

    - "In this talk, I’ll share insights on how to elevate Python beyond
      scripting. We’ll explore key language features such as type annotations,
      tools for testing and static analysis, and modern dependency management
      practices. The discussion will include projects like pylint, pyright,
      pytest, ruff, uv and more, offering a comprehensive view of Python’s
      ecosystem. We will bring it all together by looking at an example project
      utilizing community templates."

    - "Attendees will gain a fresh perspective on Python’s capabilities and
      learn practical approaches to harness its ecosystem to build scalable and

    - "Embedded development has long been dominated by proprietary, rigid
      architectures, limiting innovation and accessibility. However, the
      landscape is rapidly evolving as open source software, modular hardware
      standards, and collaborative development transform the field."

    - "In this talk, we’ll explore how open standards and tools like Zephyr
      RTOS, KiCAD, and Digilent PMod enable ultra-fast rapid prototyping,
      reducing barriers to entry and accelerating development cycles. We’ll
      discuss how these technologies empower engineers to build scalable,
      maintainable, and interoperable systems while fostering an ecosystem of
      shared knowledge and innovation."

    - "Whether you’re an embedded systems veteran or just stepping into the

  title: "The Generalist Advantage: Your Superpower"
  abstract:
    - "In a world that often celebrates specialisation, the generalist's path is
      frequently misunderstood. What is a generalist, and why is this diverse
      skill set your greatest asset? Celebrating polymaths like Leonardo da
      Vinci and Natalie Portman, I challenge the notion that being a 'jack of
      all trades, master of none' is a drawback. Instead, I affirm the power of
      mastering multiple fields and show how it can become your superpower."

    - "Through my personal journey as a multipotentialite, I’ll share how I
      overcame imposter syndrome and used the Pareto Principle to thrive across
      various domains. In the open source world, where innovation relies on
      collaboration and the blending of diverse skills, generalists bring unique
      value by connecting ideas, bridging gaps, and enabling community-driven
      problem-solving."

    - "Deep knowledge can fade, but passion for exploration lasts. This talk is
      a roadmap for anyone who’s ever felt out of place in a world that prizes
      specialisation. You’ll discover how to harness your wide range of
      interests, make exploration your greatest strength, and contribute to the
      vibrant, evolving ecosystems of open source communities."

    - "And even if you’re not a generalist yourself, you’ll gain insights into
      why having one on your team can be a game-changer, bringing fresh
      perspectives, bridging diverse skill sets, and driving innovation in ways
      that specialists alone might not achieve."

      organizations. This is especially true for the academic sector where
      mobility programs like \"Erasmus+\" enable students to be enrolled with
      different universities throughout their studies. However, the technical
      means to enable the necessary collaboration between different institutions
      and their administrations are often not adequate. Many tools for group
      messaging, file exchange, or domain-specific applications do not work or
      lack functionality as soon as users or data from outside an organization
      are involved, such that E-Mail is a widely used fall-back."
    - "Based on terminology from the recent <i>Interoperable Europe Act -
      (IEA)</i> we will present technical and semantic <i>interoperability
      solutions</i> to address these issues. On the technical side, we present
      two existing protocols: OpenCloudMesh is an open file sharing
      protocol implemented by open-source solutions like Nextcloud and ownCloud.
      The Matrix protocol enables secure, decentralized group and instant
      messaging, but might also support further use cases like video conferences
      in the future."
    - "On the semantic side, we present a case study where we, based on existing
      vocabularies, model a university course catalog in the <i>Resource
      Description Framework (RDF)</i> serialization format JSON-LD. The RDF
      representation of the course data introduces a semantic context to the
      course data, making the exchange of the catalog data independent of
      specific APIs, thus enabling interoperability across heterogeneous data
      structures and university-specific systems."
    - "The introduced technical and semantic interoperability solutions enable
      public sector bodies like universities and enterprises to improve their
      cross-organizational collaboration without giving up their digital
      sovereignty to a centralized, commercial actor."
