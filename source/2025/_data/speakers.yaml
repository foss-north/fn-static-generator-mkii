  title: "An engineer's guide to Linux Kernel upgrades"
  day: apr14
  slot: slot5
  abstract:
    - "Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a
      kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production
      engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too
      often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more
      obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But
      introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any
      other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company
      and their service of being exploited."

    - "One of the reasons SREs and engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel
      upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel
      release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel
      releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix
      release from a feature release. We also describe how kernel releases are

  title: "What is Linux kernel keystore and why you should use it in your next application"
  abstract:
    - "Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by
      any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and
      share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data,
      negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single
      byte of the underlying cryptographic material."

    - "This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native
      environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other
      using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has
      some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security
      failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may
      allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run
      an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys."

    - "On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates
      with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a
      single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets.
      Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key
      management system."

      internal needs. Not all of them are at the same quality, even if provide
      similar functionality. For the very small project and If you have 1 or 2
      open-source dependencies - you can evaluate what’s better manually, simply
      having a look at the repos, if you know what to look for. But when it
      comes to dozens and eventually hundreds of packages - it’s impossible to
      assess them all manually."
    - "Attacks on software supply chains (like high-profile Log4j vulnerability
      or Codecov attack or Python/NPM repo poisoning or intentionally malicious
      commits to XZ) showed us that we can’t rely on just random or “old good”
      open-source project without the proper verification, at each stage in your
      development pipeline."
    - "Let’s talk about health metrics and essential checks (e.g., based on
      CHAOSS and 8knot) that all developers should consider and how to easily
      automate them. I’ll show practical examples how industry leaders use tools
      like OpenSSF Scorecard and beyond to maintain open-source security posture
      at scale."
    - "Key points:<ul>
      <li>Why assessing the health of dependencies is important for everybody</li>
      <li>Curated list of frameworks and standards that work for engineers</li>
      <li>Practical use-cases (wins & fails) with tools like OpenSSF Scorecard, CHAOSS/k8not and some new tools</li>
      <li><b>Bonus:</b>how to collect metrics rolling up benefits for management and business</li></ul>"

  title: "Towards declaring crypto algorithms in SBOMs: crypto_algorithms_open_dataset"
  abstract:
    - "Cryptographic algorithms are foundational to secure software, yet their
      declaration and tracking remain inconsistent across industries. To address
      this, SCANOSS published the crypto_algorithms_open_dataset (CC0 license),
      which was officially presented here at FOSSNorth in 2024 as part of a
      wider talk about SCANOSS open data journey."
    - "This open data set is a comprehensive resource cataloging cryptographic
      algorithms with open-source implementations. This initiative marked the
      first step toward standardizing cryptographic algorithm declarations in
      Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Such standardization can reduce
      inefficiencies in compliance and foster collaboration across
      industries—from export control and security compliance to quantum safety
      readiness, among other benefits, that will be highlighted during the
      talk."
    - "The talk will will explore the dataset’s evolution, its impact in
      standardization initiatives, SCANOSS's efforts to improve crypto
      algorithms detection capabilities using crypto_algorithms_open_dataset and
      the coming donation of the open data set to Software Transparency
      Foundation, as a way to incentive contributions from other parties."
    - "Attendees will gain insights into the practical implications of these
      efforts, including how organizations can incorporate this dataset into
      their compliance workflows and how open-source contributors can
      participate in shaping this standardization effort."

      involved in all the new client facing OSS tools that SCANOSS have released

  abstract:
    - "The Tillitis TKey is an innovative new USB hardware security device which
      allows running small applications in a more secure way. The applications
      can be used for things like authentication, cryptographic signing,
      generating random numbers, and similar functions."
    - "To help emulate and secure the Tillitis TKey we added support for the
      TKey to the QEMU system emulator. This allows a developer of firmware or
      device apps to inspect, debug, and validate the functions, including
      observing memory like the stack, registers, et cetera, while running."
    - "Using an emulator with strong observability is immensely helpful not only
      when developing and debugging, but also when attempting to find out the
      impact of a security vulnerability. In this talk I will do a walkthrough
      of such a case."
