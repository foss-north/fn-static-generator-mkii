#   abstract:
#     - "The trusted computing landscape could be hard to understand for newcomers. Just at the beginning, they encounter a number of abbreviations like TEE, OPTEE, SEV, TF-A, TF-M and many more."
#     - "In this talk Marta is going to present a map of the trusted computing landscape, explaining different types hardware of support. She is going to put it in a context of implementing secure boot and trusted execution in an embedded distribution, namely Yocto-based Eclipse Oniro project."
#     - "The talk will include a map of trusted hardware technologies, illustrate how they are (or are expected to) be used, which market needs they address. Marta will show how they could be used in practice in an embedded distribution. The example will be the secure boot work in the Eclipse Oniro project, an embedded multi-OS distribution for Internet of Things (IOT) devices. The multi-OS specificity of Oniro will be used how the trusted computing technologies compare on different types of processors running Linux and Zephyr, with different security hardware support."

#     - "IEEE is a NonProfit with over 420K members in 180 Countries. We wanted to create a platform that would be in existence not for the next 3-5 years but instead for the next couple of decades to support our standards making process. We have a very diverse community. One of the first things we decided to focus on is Role Diversity. In this presentation, we will talk about how volunteers are creating groups and processes in a transparent fashion. Being 100% Open Source is a key philosophy that drives this community forward. I will review our entire community architecture and its evolution in the past year. We believe that diversity is key to both sustainability and quality. I will cover all the work done globally by our volunteers to support this."

#   abstract:
#     - "Oniro is a Free and Open Source Software, multi-platform, multi-kernel, low spec and embedded interoperable operating system based on Yocto Bitbake. In this context, from the same code base, many different images can be built, with a build matrix counting more than 40 different target images, all containing different sets of software components: which in concrete means millions of source files and -- licensing wise -- a nightmare. Bitbake is incredilby flexible, but not quite transparent as to what software is summoned in. Taming this complexity has required a new approach and developing new tools and procedures, also incorporating CVE scanning and security elements, a dedicated dashboard and Aliens4friends, our solution to find licensing information to package matching. Our presentation is a show-and-tell of how we produced a SBOM for as many as 2,000,000 files and almost 300 different licenses with a team of 3.5, also discussing the challenges and some odd discovery about popular packages."
