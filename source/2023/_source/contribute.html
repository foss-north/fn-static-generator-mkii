## Call for Papers

{% if data.general.cfpopen %}

The Call for Papers is open until <b>{{ data.general.cfpenddate }}</b> and the final speakers are contacted on <b>{{ data.general.cfpnotifydate }}</b>. We are happy to sponsor travel expenses and accomodation, but cannot pay for your time. Please visit the <a href="{{ data.general.cfpurl }}">Call for Papers registration page</a> to make your contribution. This will take you to a login page. We use OAUTH2 for this and currently support GitHub and Google as ways to authenticate. Please contact us if you want us to add more providers.

The call for paper form consists of a title for the talk, an abstract, name and biography of the speaker, and preferred slot length (25 or 45 minutes, including Q&amp;A). We also reemburse travel costs if needed. Since we have a budget to work with, we ask for the approximate cost that you want us to reemburse.

{% if data.general.cfpdone %}

The call for paper is now closed. Thank you for all contributions. The confirmed speakers are available from the <a href="speakers-and-talks.html">program</a>.

## Call for Sponsors

We want to create the meeting space for open source communities in the Nordic region. The foss-north event is one step on that path. Nothing of this would be possible by the support of our sponsors.

{% if data.general.covidcancelled %}

For 2022 we welcome sponsors at the discounted cost of <strong>1000 SEK for a Base Package</strong>. There will only be a single sponsorship tier, as the event is virtual. This package includes:

- Logo and URL on website
- Logo before presentations
- Logo on recordings of presentations

{% else %}

We are looking for sponsors of all sizes to be a part of the foss-north event. We offer the following tiers: 

<div class="bodytext">
    <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>

        <th class="leftalign">Benefit</th>
        <th>Base</th>
