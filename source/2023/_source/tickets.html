<p>Tickets bought before T.B.D: include lunch and coffee. Tickets are still sold until the day before the event, but does not include catering. We have ordered more food than weâ€™ve sold tickets on T.B.D., so we hope to be able to provide food to all participants, but we cannot guarantee this due to lead times ordering supplies.</p>

<p>Tickets are sold in the following categories:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="toptitle">Student Ticket</div>
        <div class="topsub">{{ data.general.conferencedaysdate }}</div>
