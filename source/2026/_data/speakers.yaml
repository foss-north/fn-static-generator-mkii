#     - "Open Source has in many ways already won. It is used in every product by
#       every company, to very a large degree. But we are not done. We can
#       improve: we can take this further, we can make our projects better, we can
#       enhance our communities and make sure it is done sustainably. The future is
#       ours."
#     - "Starting off with a look on the Open Source explosion that has taken us to
#       this point, Daniel discusses areas of improvement and dreams and visions for
#       our future."
