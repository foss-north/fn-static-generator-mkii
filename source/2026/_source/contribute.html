## Call for Papers

{% if data.general.cfpopen %}
We are currently accepting contributions for foss-north {{ data.general.confname
}}! Do you want to share something about free and open source software,
development methodologies, or other relevant topics? If so, we would love to
hear about it!

The Call for Papers is open until <b>{{ data.general.cfpenddate }}</b> and the
final speakers are contacted no later than <b>{{ data.general.cfpnotifydate }}</b>.
We are happy to sponsor travel expenses and accommodation, but cannot pay for
your time.  Please visit the <a href="{{ data.general.cfpurl }}">Call for Papers
registration page</a> to make your contribution. This will take you to a login
page. We use OAUTH2 for this and currently support GitHub and Google as ways to
authenticate. Please contact us if you want us to add more providers.

The call for paper form consists of a title for the talk, an abstract, name and
biography of the speaker, and preferred slot length (20 or 40 minutes, including
Q&amp;A). We also reimburse travel costs (up to 300 EUR) if needed. Since we
have a budget to work with, we ask for the approximate cost that you want us to
reimburse.

The event will be recorded and by submitting a talk proposal you agree to this.

## Call for Volunteers

foss-north is a small conference, and most of the administration around it is
done by a very small team. During the actual conference however, we require more
manpower than that, for registration, speaker introductions, microphone running,
photography, filming talks, editing filmed talks, handling social media, etc.

If you like free and open source software, and if you want to help out with any
of the things mentioned above, reach out to <a href="mailto:info@foss-north.se">
info [at] foss-north.se</a>.  We are not able to pay anything for your help, but
you'll get a ticket to the conference, and we try to schedule our work so that
you will be able to attend any talks that are of particular interest to you.

If you are interested in joining the organizing group on a more permanent basis,
we welcome that, too!

## Call for Sponsors

We want to create the meeting space for open source communities in the Nordic
region. The foss-north event is one step on that path. Nothing of this would be
possible by the support of our sponsors.

We are looking for sponsors of all sizes to be a part of the foss-north event.
We offer the following tiers:

<div class="bodytext">
    <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="leftalign">Benefit</th>
        <th>Base</th>
        <th>Silver</th>
        <th>Gold</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Cost</td>
        <td>10kSEK</td>
        <td>40kSEK</td>
        <td>75kSEK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Availability</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Logo and link</td>
        <td>Yes, small</td>
        <td>Yes, large</td>
        <td>Yes, largest</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Mention in keynote</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Appearance in keynote</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Number of free tickets</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

We are also offering a limited number of booths for our sponsors. Please tell us
if you are interested in this. We also accept niche sponsoring, if you want to,
for example, sponsor unlimited coffee at the conference.
