    -  "R itself remains part of the GNU project, licensed under the GNU General Public License, and capable of running on many free operating systems, but it is increasingly becoming popular to include non-free software and services-as-software-substitutes in R environments. Moreover, these unethical practices are often obscured from useRs, and some users may not realize that they are running non-free software. I will introduce R and some of the common ways people use it, demonstrate the recent trends towards unethical practices in R, and comment on the dangers of such practices, for the individual and for society. Finally, I will inform of what we can do about these trends, both as individuals to protect ourselves, and as a group to further a free society."

  title: "Non-Vulnerable Dependency Resolution: Reconciling development and security concerns, together"
  abstract:
    -  "The current approach to resolving dependencies (in package managers used by FOSS users) and handling vulnerable packages (in vulnerability management teams) is complex, tedious, and time-consuming. It's also a disconnected process when the development and security teams are not in sync. We can either determine if a package version is vulnerable, or we can resolve package versions for functional dependency requirements but without consideration for vulnerabilities - we cannot do both, and crossing both tools and organizational boundaries is difficult. We express dependency constraints as acceptable package version ranges, and vulnerabilities affect certain package version ranges. What if we resolve package dependencies by taking into consideration the vulnerable version ranges at the same time? In this talk, Philippe will share how non-vulnerable FOSS dependency resolution can resolve software package vulnerable version ranges and dependency version constraints at the same time. Developers can obtain a resolved package version graph matching the blended functional and vulnerability version constraints and get both non-vulnerable and up-to-date software code in a single resolution pass."

These challenges encompass sustainability, pervasiveness, agility, and diversity, all of which are needed to cater to a constantly evolving range of applications and algorithms from endpoint to edge and cloud. In this talk, we explore how adaptive devices and agile compiler stacks can provide solutions by delivering post-production hardware specialization and co-designed algorithms. This results in highly optimized AI systems which not only provide the necessary performance scalability but also bring a reduction in carbon footprint while addressing the needs of a broad range of diverse applications with the necessary agility."

  abstract:
    -  "This talk delves into how Public Sector Organizations (PSOs) and the public sector at large facilitate software reuse, specifically through Open Source Software (OSS) as an instrument. The talk draws from a recently published report commissioned by the Danish Agency for Digital Government (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen ) and Local Government Denmark (KL ), which provide input on how Danish PSOs can specifically improve at reaping benefits by reusing existing software and creating value by developing software in a way that can be reused. A qualitative survey was conducted on a sample of 16 countries considered mature in their digital practices, as indicated through a set of digital maturity indicators. These countries were surveyed in terms of government policies, rationales, support mechanisms, means of promotion, and success stories related to software reuse. The surveyed countries exhibit diverse policies, emphasizing interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency. Economic arguments, interoperability, and transparency are prominent goals, while digital sovereignty varies. Security concerns are discussed, acknowledging both risks and benefits of OSS. Several emerging support structures were identified, including Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), crucial for institutional capacity. Success stories highlight the transformation to sustainable governance enabled through the use of neutral proxy organizations acting as stewards for public sector OSS projects. The talk provides recommendations that focus on fostering software reuse through OSS adoption, aiming to guide policy- and decisionmakers at national, regional, and local government levels. The talk contributes valuable insights for countries, like Denmark and others, seeking to leverage software reuse through OSS in their digital transformations."
