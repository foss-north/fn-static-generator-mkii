  abstract:
    -  "And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I
      told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm
      quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've
      moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the
      window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were merry, but then, they
      switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline
      stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the
      Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then
      I'll set the building on fire..."
  bio:
    - "He was laid off five years ago and no one ever told him about it; but
      through some kind of glitch in the payroll department, he still gets a
      paycheck."
