## Call for Papers

{% if data.general.cfpopen %}

The Call for Papers is open until <b>{{ data.general.cfpenddate }}</b> and the final speakers are contacted on <b>{{ data.general.cfpnotifydate }}</b>. We are happy to sponsor travel expenses and accomodation, but cannot pay for your time. Please visit the <a href="{{ data.general.cfpurl }}">Call for Papers registration page</a> to make your contribution. This will take you to a login page. We use OAUTH2 for this and currently support GitHub and Google as ways to authenticate. Please contact us if you want us to add more providers.

The call for paper form consists of a title for the talk, an abstract, name and biography of the speaker, and preferred slot length (25 or 45 minutes, including Q&amp;A). We also reemburse travel costs if needed. Since we have a budget to work with, we ask for the approximate cost that you want us to reemburse.

## Call for Sponsors

We want to create the meeting space for open source communities in the Nordic region. The foss-north event is one step on that path. Nothing of this would be possible by the support of our sponsors.

We are looking for sponsors of all sizes to be a part of the foss-north event. We offer the following tiers: 

<div class="bodytext">
    <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="leftalign">Benefit</th>
        <th>Base</th>
        <th>Silver</th>
        <th>Gold</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Cost</td>
        <td>10kSEK</td>
        <td>25kSEK</td>
        <td>50kSEK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Availability</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Logo and link</td>
        <td>Yes, small</td>
        <td>Yes, large</td>
        <td>Yes, largest</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Appearance in keynote</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>5</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
