<h1>Tickets</h1>

<p>Get your ticket via the <a href="https://foss-north.se/events/2024/register/">ticket registration</a> page (requires the setup of an account).</p>

<p><i>
The ticket registration process requires you to register using an OpenID source.
At the moment we support github and Google. If you cannot identify using these
services we offer a manual process. This means getting the ticket via mail and
processing the payment via bank transfer. Please notice that this process
involves a substantial amount of additional work for the organizers so we urge
you to consider using the standard process which is quicker and easier. To
request a ticket manually, please email us at info@foss-north.se with the
subject line "Ticket foss-north 2024".

<p>Tickets bought before <strong>April 1st</strong> include lunch and coffee.
Tickets are still sold until the day before the event, but does not include
catering. We have ordered more food than weâ€™ve sold tickets on April 1st, so we
hope to be able to provide food to all participants, but we cannot guarantee
this due to lead times ordering supplies.</p>
