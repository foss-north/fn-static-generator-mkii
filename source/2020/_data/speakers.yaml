    - "In the last few years we saw a lot of discussion in the open source and free software startup space around licenses. Several companies stepped forward and claimed that it’s not possible to build a working company on top of a free software product. Some changed the license of their product to proprietary license like the Commons Clause or the Business Source License. They claim that this is needed to ‘save’ free software. This talk describes why this is fundamentally wrong. It’s possible to build a working startup and company on top of a free software product. This talk discusses how companies like Red Hat, SUSE and Nextcloud manages to have a 100% free software product including a big contributor community but is still able to pay developers and grow."

    - "Developing Free Software is fun, but dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that: with three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines."
    - "If you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, the FSFE helps developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author."

    - "As you contemplate how to put together the system software for your next Embedded Linux project you will probably be wondering which is the best path to take? Use a Linux distro such as Debian, (or another of your choosing), or create a custom operating system using Yocto Project (or Open Embedded or Buildroot). At first sight, Debian looks easy, especially if you are using a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone or another board with a pre-installed Debian-derived system. So, why go to all the trouble of replacing it with Yocto?"
    - "In this talk I will show you the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, using real-world use cases as examples. Spoiler alert: my conclusion is that … it all depends what you want to do. Debian is great for fast implementation and proof-of-concept, but for long term maintainability and control of the platform, you need Yocto. Now you need to come along to see why I believe this to be so."

    - "The conventional approach to building container images starts by importing a base image of a Linux distribution. Then a Dockerfile is used to install the software stack. Part of it might be installed into the image through the distribution's package, while the other part might be built from source. The integration of such an image requires multiple steps. The complexity of distribution packages is not that well suited for the simplicity of container images. Maintaining software builds from source through Dockerfile is also unpractical. This complexity makes it hard to maintain a container image. Freedesktop SDK is a base runtime for Linux desktop applications using Flatpak. We have used BuildStream as an integration tool to build the image without requiring depending on a distribution. The approach used also translates easily to layered Open Container Initiative (OCI) images through a BuildStream plugin. This talk will show how (multiple) OCI images can be fully built in one pass from a BuildStream specification."

  abstract:
    - "Large amounts of data are being collected about IoT systems---a tendency known as big data. Much of the collected data is private: it contains details about individuals and their behaviour. Privacy concerns about individuals restrict the way that such a huge amount of information can be used and released. In this light, information collected by IoT devices must be handled in a way that users' privacy gets preserve and thus comply with ethical, legal, or business reasons."
    - "It is often believed that data can be just anatomized somehow in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Simple removing some identifiers or data fields from a dataset is not enough. There are notorious cases that illustrate that traditional disclosure techniques lack rigorous analysis and guarantees, where re-identification attacks are possible."
    - "Differential privacy, a concept originated in academia, is currently the only mechanism that rigorously captures the trade-offs of adding noise to a query to protect the privacy of individuals while enabling to extract useful insights from it. However, adding noise might reduce how meaningful queries' results are in favour of privacy---e.g., in the extreme case, a completely random answer preserves privacy but is rather useless."
    - "In this talk, we will present DPella, a programming language being developed at Chalmers University, which enables developers to write differentially private queries, while enabling to study how meaningful the result of the queries are.

    - "In this talk will cover Monado and Khronos' OpenXR standard, and give an overview about the current state of open source VR and what lies ahead. Also go into some details of how tracking is done inside of Monado and show of the current state."
    - "VR took off for the consumer with the release of Oculus consumer hardware. But the hardware lacked open source drivers and Linux support in general. The consumer VR space has now grown from a kickstarter campaign into a large industry. But this growth has its down sides, multiple companies have their own APIs competing. Luckily these companies have agreed to work on a single API under the Khronos umbrella. Now that OpenXR has been released and and the Monado project has been getting more stable it is now possible to do good VR on a completely open stack."

  abstract:
    - "Want to run Linux with RISC-V on Open Source Hardware?"
    - "This talk will explore the current options including how open source FPGA tools can be leveraged to build open Linux-capable systems."
    - "I will explain how myself and others at Hackaday Supercon teamed up to get Linux running on RISC-V core in the ECP5 FPGA badge using only open source tools thanks to Project Trellis, yosys and nextpnr. I will explain what migen and LiteX are, and how it enabled us to quickly build a System-on-Chip (SoC) capable of running Linux on VexRiscv."
    - "In conclusion, I will explore the landscape of open source chip designprojects and the Linux-capable RISC-V silicon chips on horizon for 2020, and talk about my desire to collaborate on an affordable (<$100?) OSHW Linux RISC-V board."

  title: "Effective Documentation: The Key to Open Source Growth"
  abstract:
    - "When developers use and contribute to open source projects, effective documentation can make all the difference between a positive experience or a negative experience. Providing effective documentation can build healthy and inclusive communities, thereby increasing the usability and retention rate of your product/ project, but most often, open source creators produce ineffective documentation."
    - "In this talk, Bolaji will introduce you to unique documentation strategies that will enable you to create good, timely, useful, accurate and sustainable documentation alongside explaining the benefits of these strategies, and how you can build a documentation community around your contributors."

  title: "Managing the risk and growth of using Open Source Software"
  abstract:
    - "Today, every company is a software company. Even companies with a core business that is not about developing software products are building software to help run their businesses. More and more, development organizations are using open source software as part of their applications in order to support their agility and efficiency goals. While the benefits of using open source software are apparent, organizations need to manage the vulnerabilities and risks associated with that use. In this session you will learn about the business impact of security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues presented to organizations that use open source software. You will also learn how Software Composition Analysis tools, such as WhiteSource Software, can help to automate and simplify the process of managing vulnerability and compliance issues throughout the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC). The session will include a hands-on workshop using WhiteSource Software to scan code for open source libraries, build an inventory of these libraries, and highlight identified security vulnerabilities, the licenses associated with these libraries, and the identified risk they present."

  title: "Functional Programming with JavaScript"
  abstract:
    - "Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by. With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?"
    - "Using just a few JavaScript libraries, such as RamdaJS, developers can implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?"
    - "This talk will demonstrate how, using ES6 and a few extra libraries, we can write Functional code that is:"
    - "<ul><li>More robust</li><li>Easier to read</li><li>Easier to maintain</li></ul>"
    - "This talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language."
    - "We might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is!"
  bio:
    - "I've been working as a .NET developer for over 13 years now in a variety of industries including government, retail and manufacturing. But as a coder, I've been playing with making computers do whatever my crazed imagination could devise since I was old enough to read my Dad's copy of the ZX Spectrum BASIC coders manual."
    - "I've been speaking about Functional C# at various user groups and conferences around the UK, USA, and India, and am particularly interested in seeing just how far we can push the capabilities of C#."
    - "When I'm not coding, or running after my two small children, I have been known to enjoy the classic series of Doctor Who, Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks, Cryptic Crosswords, and rather more coffee than is probably good for me."
